Basic servo door opener. Uses a Node.js as a server which sends servo commands to an Arduino, which acts as a buffer.

Can run on any platform, but I happen to use a RasPi. The makefile is Mac-specific, but the PDE will compile with any Arduino-compatible build stack.

Node Requirements:
    sleep
    nodeserial
    express
